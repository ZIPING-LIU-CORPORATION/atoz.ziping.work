# Requested Concern Unresolved Since May 5th 2022 - Issue Checker Tracker
 
## So There's one Item of Concern That Should have Been Resolved 
Ziping Liu has been requesting for assitance on this matter with emails sent to ERC, VPs and HR USA of Amazon since [May](https://liu.academy/may/saga)

## So on May 5th, there was a very special event that happened which caused and is still causing the issue to remain:

Specifically, May 5th is the event in which Amazon legal illegaly deleted @lziping's work account, 
because the deletion or disabling was not pre-scheduled and happened suddenly and without any warning or notice or even to my knowledge, I had no idea it was going to just happen with such a dramatic way of doing so:

## Amazon Legal did it so shockingly in blatant adverse intent, 

Doing specifically an action which was a killswitch or turning off all his work laptops via a logout remote forced idiocy..., Just like one of those infamous black screen virus attacks on your PC.

## ALL WHILE, NOT WHEN ZIPING WS SLEEPING, OH NO, DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY:

Ziping Liu was in the middle of a slack/chime chat with Betthom@amazon.com. You should have been there to see it in person.

Because I was currently in a serious chat with, Betthom@amazon.com since I was discusing with Betthom that something horrible has begun. She tells me I cannot really do much on my end, I know. And then she says: All I can say is talk to career wellness, their department is not part of it. And then I sent her my terms and conditions as a form of good faith appreciated, and instantly, my laptop turns black, I realize I am completly logged out, and I have no way to ever contact betthom ever again, knowing I have been shut off from the Amazon reality, and it was that moment when I realized the end was here, and my world was over.

So that's why I have been inbetween two sectors. Can we please resovle this issue?

I set up a canary to check if it works or not so I don't have to. Canaries! I am glad i have my friendly birds to help out. No thanks to the FMLA marty walsh. 


## Canaries

So I'm almost done trailblazing the course examples LIU LLC is going to use for the web design 101 course to be released. There's one thing that is very important about web sites and its availability to users. This now goes into a whole new real of web devleopment which a lot of ppl seem to hate and think of as stupid work or work that is not at all difficult or requires much brain thought and seems to think that it is just work for idiots to do. cough cough cough, specifically which is part of the reason I'm in this idiocy of retaliation as well...?? Like this is seroiusly the dumbest campaign ever, given it was just a bunch of small idiocy that somehow attached thesmelves together to form one entire mega idiocy, of retaliation,  as we see now.


### Canaries Run Every 1-5 minutes and check if Ziping Liu's @lziping Amazon Employee Login exists or works or not. It assumes that it is still in an egregiously covered up and disabled state so it passes the canary run 'or the canary's assertion for the error', hence a canary run does not at all take much or any time. It is supposed to be fast. But just because these are fast checks doesn't mean that they are actualy like very brainless non-ability filled of ppl working on such, type of programming? Seriously? 

###
I won't rant much else but this is a very direct aggression like I'm not just ranting because I have this addiction to DEV OPS, no. 

It's because DEV OPS is not actually at all the type of brainless work, and very unimportant work that my manager told me verbatim, and hence I have no idea why, but my performance review and reports of my ability suddenly written as, in verbaitm, not meeting anywhere near the average ability expected from Amazon Developers, because in her words: "amazon is a competitive company and has the highest quality devleopers. You are no where near the metrics seen, and are just below average in ability." And I was like really? So can I try to improve with more support then from you because I can tell you are angry. And she said, we wil have to see, I'm not sure if there's any leeway for allowance of individuals marked as below average and able to have their own set of standards lower than the rest.

And I'm just like, like, are you kidding me? Well I can't blame you for see the IQ scores I posted on my LinkedIn. I do have an IQ of 100 so I am retarded. I guess I will go get accodmations for my hadnicap of retardness from Amazon DLS then. 

ANd so, that all was what happend in February, and March. And then we had April, and so yes, can you see how this is a very just, insane trail of events. Hence, can you aunderstand my own passion and drive to study it? It is such a phenonomally insane spectrum of colors in collision, you just cannot tell me, such things wouldn't have made you filled with a curious drive to understand more of this source of malfunction then, no?

## FAQS

#### Is this repo being updated? This repo doesn't do any actual full end to end testing nor have coverage of all avaiablipy points... you literally wrote three lines of code that as it seems, took you several hours to write out..

Yes we are updating this page. It is a canary and is our watchdog for letting us know of things faster than we can manually see. Ziping Liu is slow, and moves slow, so please excuse our need for this tool.


#### Okay so you just released this out of nowhere, no plans written, and so what is this supposed to be for?

This is for our set of projects now encompassing Operations Devleopment which seeks to ensure sites are maintained and polished. Our course is to handle it and we wil release more repos related to dev ops soon!.


#### Do you have the cypress dashboards avaiable to view? The Github Actions doesn't at all display graphs or showcase useful analytics

Yes you can view the canary dashboard for this check of @lziping employee account lziping@amazon.com email account status, [here](https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/t7aqz7/runs)
