# Requested Concern Unresolved Since May 5th 2022 - Issue Checker Tracker


## So There's one Item of Concern That Should have Been Resolved 
Ziping Liu has been requesting for assistance on this matter with emails sent to ERC, VPs and HR USA of Amazon since Maia 5, So on May 5th, there was a very special event that happened which caused and is still causing the issue to remain:

In particular, May 5th marks the day when Amazon removed @lziping's work account illegally because the disabling or deletion was not pre-scheduled and occurred suddenly and without warning, to my knowledge, and I had no idea that it would just happen in such a dramatic way.

#### Amazon Legal did it so shockingly in blatant adverse intent,
Doing specifically an action which was a killswitch or turning off all his work laptops via a logout remote forced idiocy..., Just like one of those infamous black screen virus attacks on your PC.

### ALL WHILE, NOT WHEN ZIPPING WAS SLEEPING, OH NO, DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY:
Ziping Liu was in the middle of a slack/chime chat with Betthom@amazon.com. You should have been there to see it in person.The reason for this is that I was recently in a serious chat with Betthom@amazon.com as we were discussing something terrible that has occurred. As she tells me, I am unable to do much. She then says: I can only recommend you talk to career wellness, because their department does not participate in it. In appreciation of her good faith, I sent her my terms and conditions, and immediately, my laptop turns black, I realize I am completely logged out, and I do not have any way of contacting Betthom ever again. At that point, I realized that I had been completely cut off from the Amazon world, and I knew my world was over at that moment, the END. I have been operating in two sectors at the same time, so I am in the middle of two processes. Could we please resolve this issue? I am very done with this stall in my life. You guys At amazon realize like everything in my life right now is just out of order, and not at all with normalcy of any type of actual life in stability? Great, I'm glad your Amazon legal team was able to rehearse some act to then display as a show to the entire amazon work force of its might and power. I'm glad you guys have shut off my world and turned my life off since May. Can we now seriously have some things executed already? I'm not going to stay this way forever. And if I have to do it the way I am getting the feeling, that might actually be required, you do realize that means prison sentencing for a lot of you VPs ?

## SO to buy you guys more time, at the corporate tower of non-action:

I set up a canary to check if it works or not so I don't have to. Canaries! I am glad I have my friendly birds to help out. No thanks to the FMLA marty walsh.

## ALL WHILE, NOT WHEN ZIPING WS SLEEPING, OH NO, DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY:

Ziping Liu was in the middle of a slack/chime chat with Betthom@amazon.com. You should have been there to see it in person.

Because I was currently in a serious chat with, Betthom@amazon.com since I was discusing with Betthom that something horrible has begun. She tells me I cannot really do much on my end, I know. And then she says: All I can say is talk to career wellness, their department is not part of it. And then I sent her my terms and conditions as a form of good faith appreciated, and instantly, my laptop turns black, I realize I am completly logged out, and I have no way to ever contact betthom ever again, knowing I have been shut off from the Amazon reality, and it was that moment when I realized the end was here, and my world was over.

So that's why I have been inbetween two sectors. Can we please resovle this issue?

I set up a canary to check if it works or not so I don't have to. Canaries! I am glad i have my friendly birds to help out. No thanks to the FMLA marty walsh. 


# Canaries
So I'm almost done trailblazing the course examples LIU LLC will use for the web design 101 course to be released.

## There is one thing that is very important regarding web sites 

**and the availability of them to outside traffic/readership/corpexecstudents** It now goes into a whole new dimension of web development, which many people seem to dislike and think is not at all difficult or requires much brainpower and is viewed as merely a job for idiots. It is specifically that reason that I am also engaged in this idiocy of retaliation...? 

_This campaign is seriously one of the stupidest campaigns ever, as it was composed of numerous small idiocies that somehow attached themselves to one entire mega idiocies of retaliation, as we can see now._

## Each 1-5 minutes, Canaries check 

Ziping Liu's @lziping Amazon Employee Login for validity or non-existence. In this case, the canary assumes that it is still in an egregiously concealed and disabled state, which is why it passes a canary test 'or the canary's assertion that the error exists', therefore a canary test takes very little time, which is intended for speed. Even though these are fast checks, does this not mean that they represent brainless, non-ability filled individuals working on such programming? Seriously?

As I mentioned earlier, I will not rant much else but such statements were actually a very directed attack against me... 

### Canaries Run Every 1-5 minutes and check if Ziping Liu's @lziping Amazon Employee Login exists or works or not. 

_**It assumes that it is still in an egregiously**_ **covered** up and **disabled** state so it passes the canary run 'or the canary's assertion for the error', hence a canary run does not at all take much or any time. It is supposed to be fast. But just because these are fast checks doesn't mean that they are actualy like very brainless non-ability filled of ppl working on such, type of programming? Seriously? 

_As I mentioned earlier, I will not rant much else but such statements were actually a very directed attack against me..._ 

**The reason I am ranting is not because I am addicted to development operations.** But, simply, due to the fact that DEVOPS is not actually brainless work; yet was stated as very unimportant by my manager in verbatim, I do not know why DEVOPS is considered brainless work...

### Because by the very definitation of DEV OPS
To the most compliant,  in good standing, and within good faith sectors or business always view DEV OPS as not actually at all the type of brainless work, and very unimportant work that my manager told me verbatim, _**and hence I have no idea why**_, but my performance review and reports of my ability suddenly written as, in verbaitm, _**not meeting anywhere near the average ability expected from Amazon Developers**_, because in her words: "_amazon is a competitive company and has the highest quality devleopers. You are no where near the metrics seen, and are just below average in ability._" 

### And I was like really? 
So can I try to improve with more support then from you because I can tell you are angry. And she said, we wil have to see, _**I'm not sure if there's any leeway for allowance of individuals marked as below average and able to have their own set of standards** lower than the rest._

My response was, "**Are you kidding me?**" Well, I can't blame you for seeing my LinkedIn IQ score since I have an IQ rating of 100 which makes me retarded. I guess I'll seek accommodation from Amazon DLS for my retardation.

Thus, that was all that transpired in February, March, and April. Now, yes, can you see that this is a very just, insane chain of events. Consequently, do you understand why I am passionate about this field and why I want to study it so much? The spectrum of colors in collision is so phenomenally insane that you cannot explain why such things would not have made you curious to discover more about the source of malfunction in the first place, would they?

## FAQS

#### Is this repo being updated? This repo doesn't do any actual full end to end testing nor have coverage of all avaiablipy points... you literally wrote three lines of code that as it seems, took you several hours to write out..

Yes we are updating this page. It is a canary and is our watchdog for letting us know of things faster than we can manually see. Ziping Liu is slow, and moves slow, so please excuse our need for this tool.


#### Okay so you just released this out of nowhere, no plans written, and so what is this supposed to be for?

This is for our set of projects now encompassing Operations Devleopment which seeks to ensure sites are maintained and polished. Our course is to handle it and we wil release more repos related to dev ops soon!.


#### Do you have the cypress dashboards avaiable to view? The Github Actions doesn't at all display graphs or showcase useful analytics

Yes you can view the canary dashboard for this check of @lziping employee account lziping@amazon.com email account status, [here](https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/t7aqz7/runs)


# Local Dev

1. `npm install`

That's it! There's no need to build sh*t. Just pretend typescript 
doesn't need compiliing at all, and just edit tyepscript without thinkinga bout build at all. THese are tests. So just think about tests.

## To Run Tests

### Running Tests with Browser UI Enabled
1. `npm run cy:open`
1. You should see a web browser pop with cypress choices, or be asked ot choose a web browser to use. If it dones't work try runnig npm install again.
1.  Click on E2E Testing
1.  Select the Tests Available based on the `./cypress/e2e/` directory. At this time there is only one Test.

Note: so yes you can edit your test files and run, while cy:open is running. 

### Running Tests with Browser UI Disabled
1. `npm run cy:run`
  - Note: Since there's only one test you simply have to run that. 
  - To specify the specific test File, run
  - `$ npx cypress  run --e2e -- --spec cypress/e2e/check-alias-exists` on your command line or..
     - add to scripts in package.json: `"start": "cypress run --config-file=cypress.config.ts --e2e --"`
     - and then run  `$ npm run start --spec cypress/e2e/check-alias-exists` on your command line
