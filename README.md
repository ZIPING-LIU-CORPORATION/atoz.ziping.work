 ## This has been requested for support by Ziping since May
 
  after Amazon legal illegaly deleted his work account and just simly turned off all his work laptops via a logout remote forced idiocy, while Ziping Liu was in the middle of a slack/chime chat with Betthom@amazon.com. You should have been there to see it in person, I tell Betthom that something horrible has begun. She tells me I cannot really do much on my end, I know. And then she says: All I can say is talk to career wellness, their department is not part of it. And then I sent her my terms and conditions, and instantly, my laptop turns black, I realize I am completly logged out, and I have no way to ever contact betthom ever again, knowing I have been shut off from the Amazon reality. The End. Jk. All this bs then happened.
