# Requested Concern Unresolved Since May 5th 2022 - Issue Checker Tracker
 
## So There's one Item of Concern That Should have Been Resolved 
Ziping Liu has been requesting for assitance on this matter with emails sent to ERC, VPs and HR USA of Amazon since [May](https://liu.academy/may/saga)

## So on May 5th, there was a very special event that happened which caused and is still causing the issue to remain:

Specifically, May 5th is the event in which Amazon legal illegaly deleted @lziping's work account, 
because the deletion or disabling was not pre-scheduled and happened suddenly and without any warning or notice or even to my knowledge, I had no idea it was going to just happen with such a dramatic way of doing so:

## Amazon Legal did it so shockingly in blatant adverse intent, 

Doing specifically an action which was a killswitch or turning off all his work laptops via a logout remote forced idiocy..., Just like one of those infamous black screen virus attacks on your PC.

## ALL WHILE, NOT WHEN ZIPING WS SLEEPING, OH NO, DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY:

Ziping Liu was in the middle of a slack/chime chat with Betthom@amazon.com. You should have been there to see it in person.

Because I was currently in a serious chat with, Betthom@amazon.com since I was discusing with Betthom that something horrible has begun. She tells me I cannot really do much on my end, I know. And then she says: All I can say is talk to career wellness, their department is not part of it. And then I sent her my terms and conditions as a form of good faith appreciated, and instantly, my laptop turns black, I realize I am completly logged out, and I have no way to ever contact betthom ever again, knowing I have been shut off from the Amazon reality, and it was that moment when I realized the end was here, and my world was over.

So that's why I have been inbetween two sectors. Can we please resovle this issue?

I set up a canary to check if it works or not so I don't have to. Canaries! I am glad i have my friendly birds to help out. No thanks to the FMLA marty walsh.
